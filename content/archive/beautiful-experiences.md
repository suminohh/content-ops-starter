  For the longest time, I relied on various website builders to create and host my personal site. No more! Partially thanks to AI.

Lately, I've been thinking what is my purpose. What was I meant to do on Earth? Instead of thinking  broadly, my husband encouraged me to reflect on what brings me joy, what do I find myself doing in my free time. This used to be a lot easier to answer when I was bored, which hasn't been the case recently.

And then it came to me as I was updating my website. Making things beautiful. Creating delightful moments.

It's not enough for me to create something for myself because what joy is there when noone can feel what I feel. It's quite lonely, melancholy, when it isn't moment that can be shared even though something makes you smile or squeal out of excitement.
