For the longest time, I relied on various website builders to create and host my personal site. I've gone through Wix, Adobe Portfolio, and most recently, an indie drag-and-drop tool. That last one unlocked building a fun personal website. It was super easy to use and quite flexible thanks to its of drag-and-drop nature, but over time, a few issues started to bug me:

1. The responsive design options were very limited. 
2. There was no support for bugs or errors.
3. It wasn't ideal for hosting blog content. 

And now with the rise of AI, I felt like I had no excuse not to try to build my own website. 

I took an intro to web development class during college where we dabbled in HTML and CSS, but I figured the experience I gained from side projects over the years might get me somewhere, especially with the help of AI. Between Google AI Studio, Claude, and Cursor, I considered designing in Figma and vibe coded my way through, but I was lazy and wanted to launch quickly, so I "cheated." 

I found a free template and started modifying that instead! It didn't require much AI assistance because it was pretty straightforward to review the files and get the gist. For things I wasn't sure about, I turned to Cursor. (Cursor wouldn't cooperate so I did some manual copy-and-pastes.)

It's taking me some time to add new pages and create visual assets, but I'm so excited to finally be in control. Every issue I run into is now a reflection of my own skillset and an opportunity to upskill! It's incredibly liberating. 

And honestly, I'm really happy I no longer have to spend $200 a year simply because I didn't know how to do something. That was honestly my biggest motivator.
