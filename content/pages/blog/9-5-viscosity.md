  I used to think "culture" was just one of those fluffy buzzwords tossed around on Linkedin, but now I feel it through and through. Work can't be sunshine and butterflies but I believe with the right attitude, 9-5 can be something more.

Before I pivoted into product, I spent some time as a designer working on both digital experiences and physical products. My design experience was mostly with early-stage startups that didn't have formal product managers. While product managers do exist for physical goods, I never worked with one during my time as an industrial designer. This meant identifying customer needs and deciding which features to prioritize fell on my lap. I either worked directly with CTOs or senior dev leads, or I took on the role of an engineer creating CAD models for manufacturing. In setups that lean, there weren't many layers between decisions and execution, which meant little risk of misalignment and interpersonal friction. In hindsight, I had it easy; these challenges weren't even on my mind.

As I've grown into a larger organization, I've come to see how important teamwork and ownership really are. Experiencing environments where these weren't always present taught me firsthand how critical culture is for effectively delivering on goals and retaining employees. I used to think "culture" was just one of those fluffy buzzwords tossed around on Linkedin, but now I feel it through and through.

### Not just my company's project

Ownership and teamwork go hand in hand, but without ownership nothing gets done. That final deliverable embodies the many aspects and efforts a team considers and practices. While deliverables are the end goal, their quality and execution speak to the ownership and integrity of the team. They shows up in many ways: gathering the necessary context by identifying the relevant colleagues and asking questions, paying close attention to the work being defined, making sure all the stakeholders are aligned, thinking ahead about potential technical or resource conflicts. To know, or to learn, what it takes to become better, and to actually put it into practice even when no one is looking takes integrity. But as humans, we sometimes have blind spots, things we miss, and this is where your team steps in.

### Not just my project

The team that cares, the team that aims for the common goal, fills in your blind spots. Teamwork lightens the mental load and makes challenges easier to face. I really appreciate not feeling alone in carrying the weight of responsibility. I love seeing an idea bloom into something greater through sharing and collaboration. It's exciting to watch informational walls break down. Still, every so often, gaps in accountability or passion can slow a project's momentum. No matter how much effort or ownership you bring, achieving a smooth product experience is nearly impossible without the support of a strong, caring team. 

Speaking of balance, the beauty of building a product is being able to work with people with different backgrounds and strengths. Some are more knowledgeable about certain topics, while others bring more enthusiasm to the table. Although it may be easier to work as a homogeneous team with a shared base of knowledge and skills, a member who hasn't had the same exposure to a problem space may offer a fresh perspective, an innovative or perhaps a delightful touch. I think teamwork in cases like these means being patient, showing humility, and offering grace. 

Colleagues who don't just care about work but about how we could work better together make the 9-5 a much more pleasant and rewarding time. I'm especially grateful for teammates who keep communication open and share the pieces that keep the projects rolling. Silos often emerge when an org is rushing to grow while juggling a full stack of projects to deliver, but when we take the time to share knowledge and check in, we grow and move forward together as a unit.

I've come across different schools of thought about work. Some people only care to show up to complete the task at hand, while others aim to make most out of the process. Work can't be sunshine and butterflies but I believe with the right attitude, 9-5 is an opportunity to upskill and continually better yourself in ways that make the work more meaningful.
