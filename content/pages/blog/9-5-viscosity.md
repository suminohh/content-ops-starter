  I used to think "culture" was just one of those fluffy buzzwords tossed around on Linkedin, but now I feel it through and through. Work can't be sunshine and butterflies but I believe with the right attitude, 9-5 can be something more.

Before I pivoted into product, I spent some time as a designer working on both digital experiences and physical products. My design experience was mostly with early-stage startups that didn't have formal product managers. While product managers do exist for physical goods, I never worked with one during my time as an industrial designer. This meant identifying customer needs and deciding which features to prioritize fell on my lap. I either worked directly with CTOs or senior dev leads, or I took on the role of an engineer creating CAD models for manufacturing. In setups that lean, there weren't many layers between decisions and execution, which meant little risk of misalignment and interpersonal friction. In hindsight, I had it easy. These challenges weren't even on my mind.

As I've grown into a larger organization, I've come to see how important teamwork and ownership really are. Experiencing environments where these weren't always present taught me firsthand how critical culture is for effectively delivering on goals and retaining employees. I used to think "culture" was just one of those fluffy buzzwords tossed around on Linkedin, but now I feel it through and through.

### Ownership and Integrity

Ownership and teamwork go hand in hand, but without ownership nothing gets done. A deliverable is more than just the end result; it reflects the collective effort and integrity of the team. Ownership shows up in many ways: gathering the necessary context by identifying the relevant colleagues and asking questions, paying close attention to the work being defined, making sure all the stakeholders are aligned, thinking ahead about potential technical or resource conflicts. Integrity is knowing, or learning, what it takes to improve your craft, and putting that into practice even when no one is watching. But ofcourse, as humans, we have blind spots, and that's where your team steps in.

### Together

The team that cares, the team that aims for the common goal, fills in your blind spots. Teamwork lightens the mental load and makes challenges easier to face. I really appreciate not feeling alone in carrying the weight of responsibility. I love seeing an idea bloom into something greater through sharing and collaboration. It's exciting to watch informational walls break down. No matter how much effort or ownership you bring, achieving a smooth product experience is nearly impossible without the support of a strong, caring team. 

The beauty of building a product lies in working with people who bring different backgrounds and strengths. Some are more knowledgeable about specific topics, while others bring more enthusiasm to the table. Although it may seem easier to work with a homogeneous team with a shared base of knowledge and skills, someone new to the problem space can often offer a fresh perspective, an innovative or even a delightful touch. I think teamwork in cases like these means being patient, showing humility, and offering grace. 

Colleagues who not only care about the work but also bout how we work together make the workday far more rewarding. I'm especially grateful for teammates who keep communication open and share the pieces that keep  projects rolling. Silos often emerge when an org is rushing to grow while juggling a full stack of projects, but when we take the time to share knowledge and check in, we grow and move forward together as a unit.

I've come across different schools of thought about work. Some people only care to show up to complete the task at hand, while others aim to make most out of the process. Work can't be sunshine and butterflies but I believe with the right attitude, 9-5 is an opportunity to upskill and continually better yourself in ways that make work more meaningful.
